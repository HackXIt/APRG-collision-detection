# APRG-group-projects
A repository for the group project in advanced programming course running:

- [a collision-detection algorithm via SFML](./collision-detection)
- [a convex-hull algorithm visualization](./convex-hull)

# Library examples

To simplify project setup, the repository includes 2 example projects.

These example projects serve the purpose of testing your project setup and the library dependencies.

- `sdl2-example` is a minimal example project using SDL2. The setup is explained in [`GUIDE-Development-Setup-SDL2.md`](./docs/GUIDE-Development-Setup-SDL2.md)
- `sfml-example` is a minimal example project using SFML. The setup is explained in [`GUIDE-Development-Setup-SFML.md`](./docs/GUIDE-Development-Setup-SFML.md)

Both projects serve no meaning, other than opening a window using said library, which basically tests the compilation and linking via cmake.

For our projects we have chosen **SFML** as the library to use.
